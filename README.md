## ðŸ“„ Summary

This project investigates the use of on-demand explanatory feedback generated by large language models (LLMs) in online tutor training lessons. Drawing on 2,600+ lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, the study analyzes posttest outcomes using both intent-to-treat and treatment-on-the-treated models, including controls for self-selection via principal stratification and propensity modeling.

Key findings include:
- Learners who chose to engage with LLM-generated feedback scored significantly higher on posttests.
- Learning gains were small to moderate (up to 0.33 SD), with no significant increase in lesson time.
- Learners overwhelmingly rated the feedback as helpful (94%).
